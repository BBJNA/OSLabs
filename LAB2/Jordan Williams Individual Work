2.14) The use of periodic timer interupts could be used to monitor the code that is currently executing with the timer interupts. When code is executing a monitor will see if it is being consistent throughout the code. These are important for the system to increase concurency by optimizing the various sections.

2.19) No two systems are the same so we need to have it be modifiable. Allowing the policy to change at will and have the mechanism static we can have a flexible OS.

2.20) Virtual memory and storage is an example of tightly coupled systems. Virtual memory can be allocated for files inside of a process. However the virtual memory has to be physically allocated in storage where nothing already exists.

2.21) Advantage of using a microkernel is it allows you to add new services without modifying the kernel. User programs and system services interact with each other by using interprocess communications. A disadvantage is also in the interprocess communications and having to allocate "a lot" of memory for them.
